# There are three main folders: 
1. Code
2. InputFiles
3. Output Files

## Charter mode Discards & Private mode Discards (Federally regulated seasons):

1- The files needed to start are the scripts in the code folder (start with regs_table.r), the csv version of the genrec file (already in the folder), and the state open season days table.

## Private mode Discards (Federally regulated until 2016, State regulated 2013-2019, Federal and state from 2013-2016):

1- Similar steps to charter mode discards except the season lengths are more complicated and include state season closures.

**The numbered scripts create csv files that can easily be minipulated for fleets in SS.**
